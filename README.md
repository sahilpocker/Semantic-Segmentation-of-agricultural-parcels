# Semantic Segmentation of Agricultural Parcels

This repository contains code for semantic segmentation of agricultural parcels using UNet3D with ConvLSTM, using the PASTIS dataset.

## Overview

The project focuses on utilizing deep learning techniques for semantic segmentation, specifically designed for agricultural parcel delineation. It uses the UNet3D+ConvLSTM model architecture to process satellite image time series data and generate precise semantic segmentation masks for agricultural parcels.

## Contents

- **Notebook Files:**
  - `semantic_segmentation_agriculture.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
  
## Usage

To run the semantic segmentation model:
1. Open the `semantic_segmentation_agriculture.ipynb` notebook on Google Colab.
2. Click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the notebook to launch it in Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code step-by-step.
